# Afterpay Ruby

Based on the [API docs](https://developers.afterpay.com/afterpay-online/reference)

Afterpay Ruby is a Ruby wrapper for Afterpay API. It provides simple DSL and serialization to Afterpay's API attribute. This version supports the v2 version of Afterpay API.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'afterpay-sdk'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install afterpay-sdk

## Usage

You need to configure Afterpay using your Merchant ID and secret.

For Rails, put this in your initializer.

```ruby
Afterpay.configure do |config|
  config.app_id = <app_id>
  config.secret = <secret>

  # Sets the environment for Afterpay
  # defaults to sandbox
  # config.env = "sandbox" # "live"

  # Sets the user agent header for Afterpay requests
  # Refer https://developers.afterpay.com/afterpay-online/reference#configuration
  # config.user_agent_header = {pluginOrModuleOrClientLibrary}/{pluginVersion} ({platform}/{platformVersion}; Merchant/{merchantId}) { merchantUrl }
  # Example
  # config.user_agent_header = "Afterpay Module / 1.0.0 (rails/ 5.1.2; Merchant/#{ merchant_id }) #{ merchant_website_url }"

end
```

  shipping: <Money | optional>,
  discounts: [<Afterpay::Discount | optional>],
  billing_address: <Afterpay::Address | optional>,
  shipping_address: <Afterpay::Address | optional>,
)

# OR

order = Afterpay::Order.new(
  ...
)
order.create


order.success?
=> true
order.token
=> xxxxxxx

# Error

order.success?
=> false
order.error
=> Afterpay::Error:0x00007f8a63953888
  @id="48da0bce49d39625",
  @code="invalid_object",
  @message="merchant.redirectConfirmUrl must be a valid URL, merchant.redirectConfirmUrl may not be empty" >
```
